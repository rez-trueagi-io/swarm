    A branch predictor is a device which allows a robot to interpret
    conditional expressions.  The syntax for a conditional expression
    is `if` followed by three arguments: a boolean test and then
    two delayed expressions (i.e. expressions in curly braces) of the same type.

- name: ADT calculator
  display:
    attr: device
    char: '±'
  description:
  - |
    A calculator with Advanced Display Technology (an attached
    typewriter that can print out the results).  For some reason, in
    addition to the usual arithmetic on numbers, an ADT calculator can
    also do arithmetic on types!  After all, the helpful typewritten manual
    explains, a type is just a collection of values, and a finite collection
    of values is just a fancy number.  For example, the type `bool` is
    just a fancy version of the number 2, where the two things happen to be
    labelled `false` and `true`.  There are also types `unit` and
    `void` that correspond to 1 and 0, respectively.
  - |
    The product of two types is a type of pairs, since, for example,
    if `t` is a type with three elements, then there are 2 * 3 = 6
    different pairs containing a `bool` and a `t`, that is, 6 elements
    of type `bool * t`.  For working with products of types, the ADT
    calculator enables pair syntax `(a, b)` as well as the projection
    functions `fst : a * b -> a` and `snd : a * b -> b`.
  - |
    The sum of two types is a type with two options; for example, a
    value of type `bool + t` is either a `bool` value or a `t` value,
    and there are 2 + 3 = 5 such values.  For working with sums of
    types, the ADT calculator provides the injection functions `inl :
    a -> a + b` and `inr : b -> a + b`, as well as the case analysis
    function `case : (a + b) -> (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> c`.  For
    example, `case (inl 3) (\x. 2*x) (\y. 3*y) == 6`, and `case (inr
    3) (\x. 2*x) (\y. 3*y) == 9`.

    over which you can communicate with your robots.
  - |
    Antennas can also be used to locate nearby actors, by bouncing radio
    waves off them and listening for the echo.  This capability can be
    accessed via two commands:
  - |
    `meet : cmd (() + actor)` tries to locate a
    nearby actor (a robot, or... something else?) up to one cell away.
    It returns a reference to the nearest actor, or a unit value if
    none are found.
  - |
    `meetAll : (b -> actor -> cmd b) -> b -> cmd b` runs a command on
    every nearby actor (other than oneself), folding over the results
    to compute a final result of type `b`.  For example, if `x`, `y`,
    and `z` are nearby actors, then `meetAll f b0` is equivalent to
    `b1 <- f b0 x; b2 <- f b1 y; f b2 z`.
